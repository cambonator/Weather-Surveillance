This program can compare typical weather for a variety of locations around the 
world using standard .EPW format weather files that can be downloaded
from https://energyplus.net/weather


Run web_scrap.py file first to scrape all the data files to 
the subfolder if you don't have the data yet

The UI Index File builds an index that can be used for 
a frontend once that is built

The Weather Surveillance file has the backend to generate and plot
data using the weather files

TODO:
    Label and organize files by region when I import them
    Create UI for selecting which cities you want to compare
